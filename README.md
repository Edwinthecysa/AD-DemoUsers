# AD-Demo-Accounts Script

When setting up a test Active Directory with a high volume of users, generating realistic demo accounts can be quite complex. A basic PowerShell script can create numerous accounts quickly, but ensuring these accounts have authentic names, valid addresses, and correctly formatted postal codes is another challenge. To address this, you'll need two key components: input files with realistic data such as names and addresses, and a script capable of using this data to generate user accounts. This repository provides both of these essentials to streamline the process.

# Purpose

The script is designed to generate a customizable number of user accounts with the following attributes:

* Username (sAMAccountName)
* Login ID (UPN)
* Employee Number
* First name
* Last name 
* Display name
* E-mail address
* Street address
* City
* Postal code
* Province
* Country
* Phone number
* Department
* Job Title


Active directory user accounts created by the PowerShell script

# Data Accuracy

To achieve realistic results, accurate data is essential. This includes lists of first names, last names, addresses, and correlations between postal codes and phone area codes. The AD-Demo-Users.ps1 script expects each of these datasets in separate CSV files. The files are provided with a variety of first names, last names and addresses from various countries.

Should you wish to have your users reside in another country, you can edit the respective .txt files included.

# Using AD-demo-Users.ps1

Running the script is straightforward - launch the script via PowerShell. I have tested the script directly on my lab’s domain controller, where it performed as expected. However, it is designed to be versatile and should also work seamlessly when executed from a domain member. The script interacts with Active Directory objects and relies on appropriate permissions, so as long as the executing account has the necessary privileges, it will function correctly regardless of whether it is run from the domain controller or a domain member.

Before running the script, it's important to configure a few settings to tailor it to your needs. At the top of the script, you'll find a section dedicated to global variables. This section allows you to adjust several key parameters, such as:

1. The number of user accounts to create.
2. The organizational unit (OU) where these accounts will be placed.
3. The variety of addresses to use for the generated accounts.
4. Additional customization options based on your requirements.

In this same section, you’ll also find the names of the data files required by the script. If you choose to use the provided default files, no further changes are necessary. However, if you opt to create and use your own data files, ensure that the filenames specified in the script match those of your files to avoid any issues. This setup ensures that the script runs smoothly and produces the desired results.
